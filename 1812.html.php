                    <p>At the outset of the 19th century, Great Britain was locked in a long and bitter conflict with Napoleon Bonaparte’s France. In an attempt to cut off supplies from reaching the enemy, both sides attempted to block the United States from trading with the other. In 1807, Britain passed the Orders in Council, which required neutral countries to obtain a license from its authorities before trading with France or French colonies.</p>

                    <p>The Royal Navy also outraged Americans by its practice of impressment, or removing seamen from U.S. merchant vessels and forcing them to serve on behalf of the British. In 1809, the U.S. Congress repealed Thomas Jefferson’s unpopular Embargo Act, which by restricting trade had hurt Americans more than either Britain or France. Its replacement, the Non-Intercourse Act, specifically prohibited trade with Britain and France. It also proved ineffective, and in turn was replaced with a May 1810 bill stating that if either power dropped trade restrictions against the United States, Congress would in turn resume non-intercourse with the opposing power</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Causes of the War</h2>

                    <p>In the War of 1812, the United States took on the greatest naval power in the world, Great Britain, in a conflict that would have an immense impact on the young country’s future. Causes of the war included British attempts to restrict U.S. trade, the Royal Navy’s impressment of American seamen and America’s desire to expand its territory.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Effects of the War</h2>

                    <p>The war of 1812 was thought of as a relatively minor war but it had some lasting results, It is thought of as a decisive turning point in canadians and native americans losing efforts to govern themselves. The war also put an end to the federalist party. The party had been accused of being unpatriotic because they were against war. Some people think the most important effect of the war was the confidence that it gave america.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        "The war has renewed and reinstated the national feelings and character which the Revolution had given, and which were daily lessened. The people . . . . are more American; they feel and act more as a nation; and I hope the permanency of the Union is thereby better secured." - First Lady Dolley Madison, 24 August 1814, writing to her sister as the British attacked Washington, D.C.
