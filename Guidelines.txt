Format:
-Two paragraph intro
-Two sections
-One quote (related to person in section) in one section
-One picture (related to section) in the other

Guide:
-For the intro, talk about what it is why it was important to the time period, and
what effect it had on American history.
-For each section, pick an issue related to the overall issue. For example, a
good second section for impressment would be it being the cause of the embargo.
This would be an excellent transition, so please do that.
-Make sure at least one person significant to the issue is talked about in each section.
-The quote can be something a significant person said in relation to the topic 
covered in that section.
-The picture should be either related to that issue or a picture of someone mentioned
in the section.

Email your content to me at jessebamawells@gmail.com.

Please actually put forth effort, your name will be on the page you did. If you send
me shit content, we get a shit grade. Two people can work together on the same section,
as there are more people than sections in our group. Just make sure you have both your
names on the email. You (and your partner if you have one) will present the page that
you worked on.

Thanks,
